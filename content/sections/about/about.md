I'm a fresh graduate from a dual Master's program between the Illinois Institute of Technology  (<a href="https://www.iit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">IIT</a> - Chicago, IL, USA) and the École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d'Aérotechnique (<a href="https://www.ensma.fr/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">ISAE-ENSMA</a> - Poitiers, France). I have both a <u>Master of Science in Autonomous Systems and Robotics </u>, as well as a <u>Diplôme d'Ingénieur</u> (which is recognized as a Master of Science) <u>in Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering </u>.

Aside from that, I do dance on an intermediate level, and recently picked up on photography - analog and digital! You can find my pictures in the <u> Photography </u> section.
