## Credits

This project was undertaken under the supervison of <a href ="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sridharm/" target = "_blank"> Dr. Mohan Sridharan </a> at the School of Computer Science in Birmingham, UK, and with the help of <a href = "https://arthurfindelair.com/" target = "_blank"> Arthur Findelair </a>, at that time student at ISAE-ENSMA, who was in charge of running the simulation. 

## The main idea

Ordering food at your favorite restaurant with just a mere hand sign? That's the main idea. 

## The knowledge representation

You can find the knowledge domain designed for this project on <a href = 'https://github.com/niwya/restaurant_ASP_SPARC' target="_blank"> my GitHub </a>, as well as a more in-depth description of the knowledge domain I coded on <a href = 'https://github.com/ArthurFDLR/Commonsense-Reasoning-Bot' target="_blank"> Arthur's GitHub </a> (most of the READ ME is about the ASP code).

## The Pytorch simulation

You can find the simulated environment designed for this project - and how to make it work - on <a href = 'https://github.com/ArthurFDLR/Commonsense-Reasoning-Bot' target="_blank"> Arthur's GitHub </a> (at the beginning of the READ ME).

## Publications

A publication on an updated version of this project was presented at the KR 2022 conference in Haifa, Israel. Many thanks to Kevin Gloagen, student at ISAE-ENSMA, for taking over this project and adding functionalities.
