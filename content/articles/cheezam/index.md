## The main idea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a French person, I love myself a good cheese board at a restaurant. And from time to time, one cheese out of the selection is just celestial. In that case, I want to know what cheese it is - and to keep its info, to treat myself sometime in the future. I could just ask the restaurant personnel - right? Or, develop my own app so that if I take a picture of a delicious piece of cheese, the app tells me exactly what it is - kind of when you want to know what a piece of music is and you use Shazam.

*Note: this was a school project conducted at IIT, but to be honest, I love the idea so much that I will probably improve this project over time and maybe develop an actual app in the future. I'll post any update here!*
